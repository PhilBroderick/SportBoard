# SportBoard

Pinterest like social media website that allows users to create a feed. Feeds require a main picture and title to be associated with them.
Other users can then create posts under these feeds with their own pictures relating to the main feed. These posts can be thumbsed up/down,
and users can also comment on these posts, each with their own upvote/downvote ability.

Users will get notifications whenever they get a new post on their feed, or a new comment on their post, along with notifications when an administrator responds to a feed deletion request.

# Administrator Privilages

There are various roles, such as support, for support desk users, up to administrators, who can amend/edit/delete posts and feeds, as well as create new roles and send invites out to users to become administrators/ other roles.
